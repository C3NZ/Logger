# Logger
## A simple, lightweight, static logging utility

Logger aims to simplify logging while maintaining a relatively small code base. This is meant for smaller projects at the time but I have plans to scale it to suite larger application needs.

## Logger can...
* Write to text files, the console, or both!
* Write to any dir or file name of choice
* Keep track of the module logger was called from
* Keep track of the line number logger was called from
